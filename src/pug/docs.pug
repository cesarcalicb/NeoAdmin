				h2.docs-title#Compilation-of-source-files Compilation of source files

				p The theme is built using SASS and PugJs which are in turn compiled into HTML and CSS by Webpack. If you are not familiar with Webpack, #[a(href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/", target="_blank", rel="noopener") here] is a guide to get started. If you are familiar with Webpack follow the instruction mentioned bellow to edit or customize the source. 

				p If you don't want to edit theme you can use the compiled files directly inside #[code dist] folder.

				p Run #[code npm install] command in project root directory to install and build dependencies.

				p Use #[code npm run start] task to edit and compile source files on the go or use #[code npm run build] task to compile all source files at once.

				h2.docs-title#Layout-Customization Layout Customization

				p The layout is built using PugJs. All the layout source files are located in #[code src/pug] directory. There are two sub directories inside this directory: 

					ol
						li #[code layout] - Includes common HTML skeleton layout which is extended by all the pages
						li #[code includes] - Includes layout partials like sidebar and navbar and footer

				h2.docs-title#Style-Customization Style Customization
				p The styles are written in SASS. All the style files are located in #[code src/sass] directory. There is a file in this directory #[code neoadmin.sass] which imports all the files and exported as neoadmin.css There are two subdirectories inside this directory:

					ol
						li #[code vendors] - It includes styles of all the external libraries which contains the variables required for the application
						li #[code neoadmin] - It contains the basic style like overall structure css and theming options
				p The neoadmin subdirectory contains the following:
					ol
						li #[code files *.scss] - These SASS files have the general settings and start variables of the themes.
						li #[code component] - It contains the styles for the components like card, widgets, sidebar, navbar etc
						li #[code pages] - It contains the styles for the specific pages like login page, lock-screen page 
				
				p To customize the primary color of the theme and sidebar you need to change the variables in the #[code scss/_var.scss]. The detailed documentation about changing the colors is mentioned in this file itself.

				p If you don't want to use particular component or plug-in just comment the import statement for that particular component in #[code src/sass/neoadmin.scss] and compile the SASS by running #[code npm run build] command.

				h2.docs-title#Compatibility-with-other-frameworks Compatibility with other frameworks
				p This theme is not built for a specific framework or technology like Angular or React etc. But due to it's modular nature it's very easy to incorporate it into any front-end or back-end framework like Angular, React or VueJs or Node JS. The CSS is modular enough to be incorporated in any framework. While the Javascript used to make the components interactive can be used from any of the following framework.

				p If you are using Angular you can use #[a(href="https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/", rel="noopener") ui-bootstrap], for React use #[a(href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/", rel="noopener") React-Bootstrap] and for VueJs you can use #[a(href="https://yuche.github.io/vue-strap/", rel="noopener") VueStrap].

				p If you are using Node JS as your web server you can use pug as your layout engine to render html templates as is without compiling them to HTML. More details are available #[a(href="https://pugjs.org/api/express.html", target="_balnk") here].

				h2.docs-title#RTL-Support RTL Support

				p To enable RTL support
					ul
						li Uncomment this line #[code @import 'component/rtl';] in #[code src/sass/neoadmin.scss]. 
						li Webpack will include the style automatically, but you can also add #[code dir="rtl"] attribute to #[code &lt;html&gt;] tag in #[code src/pug/layouts/_layout.pug].
						li Build the source files using #[code npm run build] command.
